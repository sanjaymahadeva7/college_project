# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks based on historical price data. It visualizes the predictions using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for comparing predicted and actual prices, as well as forecasting future trends.

## Features

- Data preprocessing including normalization and sequencing
- Training an LSTM model on historical Bitcoin price data
- Predicting Bitcoin prices on test data
- Visualizing actual vs. predicted prices using Streamlit
- Forecasting future Bitcoin prices and visualizing the predictions

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Necessary Python libraries (see requirements.txt)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-price-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd bitcoin-price-prediction
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the historical Bitcoin price data CSV file named `bitcoin.csv` in the project directory.

2. Load the pre-trained LSTM model (ensure the model file `Bitcoin.keras` is in the correct path):

```python
model = load_model(r"C:\Users\My PC\Downloads\Sanjay_final_year_project\Bitcoin.keras")
```

3. Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Open your web browser and go to the local Streamlit URL provided in the terminal to interact with the application.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Load historical Bitcoin price data from a CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Reverse the data to maintain chronological order, drop non-essential columns, and normalize the data.
3. **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Preparation**: Create sequences of 100 days for the LSTM model.
5. **Model Training**: Train the LSTM model using the training set.
6. **Prediction and Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the test set and predict future Bitcoin prices.
7. **Visualization**: Use Streamlit to visualize the actual vs. predicted prices and future price predictions.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional features like trading volume and market sentiment for improved accuracy.
- Experiment with other machine learning models and compare performance.
- Implement real-time data fetching and prediction updates for dynamic forecasts.
